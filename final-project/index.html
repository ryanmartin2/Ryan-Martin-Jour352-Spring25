                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes, ranking the top 100 most accomplished athletes since 2000 wasn't quite so easy after all --
                        but it sure was fun. Twenty-five years ago, the ESPN SportsCentury project ranked the top 100
                        North American athletes of the 20th century. Michael Jordan came in first, followed by Babe
                        Ruth, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Wayne Gretzky. (Ruth should have been No. 1, but hey, I'm a
                        baseball writer.) We also ranked a horse: Secretariat came in at No. 35.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With so many transcendent athletes over the past 25 years, we thought it was time to do another
                        ranking. I promise you there are no horses this time (sorry, American Pharoah). In considering
                        the best athletes of the 21st century, however, we have expanded our choices beyond North
                        America. ESPN editions from around the globe contributed to the nominations and voting process,
                        as well as the individual sport list rankings that will follow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Voters were instructed to consider only an athlete's performance since 2000. So, for Barry
                        Bonds: He won seven MVP awards, but only four of those came after 2000, as did 317 of his 762
                        home runs. Or Ken Griffey Jr.: He played until 2010, but all of his best seasons came in the
                        1990s. Tiger won 13 of his 15 majors from 2000 on, so he's in good shape. Other athletes, such
                        as Patrick Mahomes or Nikola Jokic or Shohei Ohtani, obviously have more greatness ahead of
                        them, so we'll see how high their accomplishments so far get them on the list.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the end, we received more than 70,000 votes from ESPN contributors to create our top 100.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
Experts in individual sports were asked to vote to rank the top athletes in their sport since
                        Jan. 1, 2000 (no accomplishments before this date were to be considered). Those votes pared down
                        pools in each sport to lists of 10 to 25 athletes each, which constituted the overall candidate
                        pool for the top athletes of the 21st century so far. Each voter was presented two randomly
                        selected names and asked to pick which one has had the better career in the 21st century. Across
                        repeated, randomized head-to-head matchups, more than 70,000 votes were cast at this stage, and
                        using an Elo rating system, the list was pared down from 262 to 100. That list was then
                        evaluated by a panel of experts for any inconsistencies or oversights, resulting in the top 100
                        ranking seen here.
